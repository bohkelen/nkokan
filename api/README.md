# `api/`

Backend service package.

Planned responsibilities (Phase 1):

- ingestion pipeline entry points (raw capture → lossless IR → normalized records)
- provenance enforcement (entry/sense/example)
- transliteration service/module hooks (Latin → N’Ko + uncertainty flags)
- moderation queue for anonymous suggestions (audit + rollback)

No service code has been added yet.
